Continuous integration
==========================

As code complexity grows, it is important to set-up tools that allow to automatically run a series of test. This is
the goal of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).

# Concepts

GitHub actions concepts are described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions)
- One repository can have several workflows (one for R build, one for Java build for instance).
- Each `workflow` is started following an event (a push on the repository for instance)
- Each `worklow` is a succession of `jobs`
- Each `job` is a succession of `steps`

# GitHub action files

A GitHub action is created when a `.yml` file is created in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. To create an action file using predefined templates, go to your repository GitHub page. Click on the `Actions` button. You will come up on a page suggesting different GitHub Action templates depending on your project (Python, R, Java, etc.).

</div>

The beginning of the file is as follows:

```
name: r-build

on: [push]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  r-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

In this case, the workflow `r-build` starts on `push`, it contains one job (`r-build`, which runs on `ubuntu`).

The following must be the different steps of the job (cf. below for some steps).

**Notes:**
- It is advised that each workflow contains a single job.
- It is advised that the `workflow` and `jobs` names are consistent, **and are of Unix types**

# Some steps 

- To checkout the repository: 
```
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
- To install a Java environment:
```
- name: Set up JDK 1.8
  uses: actions/setup-java@v1
  with:
     java-version: 1.8
```
- To install an R environment:
```
- name: R install
  uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
```
- To install some R packages
```
- name: Install Osmose dependencies
  run: install.packages(c("rlist", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "stringr", "ncdf4", "mgcv", "fields"), repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  shell: Rscript {0}
```

The R packages will be installed in `/home/runner/work/_temp/Library`

- To install Aptitude packages
```      
- name: Install NetCDF and Latex
  run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yq libnetcdf-dev texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra
```
        
 # Caching
 
 In order to make it more efficient, there is the possibility to cache some files (for instance, package dependencies, etc.). 
 
 This is done by adding the following:
 
 ```
- name: Cache R dependencies
  id: r-dep
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  env:
     cache-name: r-dep-modules
  with:
     path: /home/runner/work/_temp/Library
     key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}
     restore-keys: |
         ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
         ${{ runner.os }}-build-
         ${{ runner.os }}-
```  

You can decide to skip some actions depending on whether the cache was restored or not. This is done by adding a `if` statement:

```
if: steps.r-dep.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
```
Note that in this case, `r-dep` is the `id` of the caching action.

```
- name: Install Osmose dependencies
  if: steps.r-dep.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  run: install.packages(c("rlist", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "stringr", "ncdf4", "mgcv", "fields"), repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  shell: Rscript {0}
```
                
Some examples are provided [here](https://github.com/actions/cache).
 
# GitHub Badges

If you want to show on your repository page the results of the compilation tests, you need to add badges at the top of the `README.md` file.

Below is a list possible badges (more badges are available [here](https://shields.io/)).

## CRAN badge
```
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/osmose)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmose)
```

## Last Release badge

Only available on **public** repositories.

```
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/osmose-model/osmose.svg)](https://github.com/osmose-model/osmose/releases)
```

## Action badge

**Only works if the workflow name is of Unix type**

```
[![R Build Status](https://github.com/osmose-model/osmose-private/workflows/r-build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/osmose-model/osmose-private/actions)
```

### Issues badge

Only available on **public** repositories.

```
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/osmose-model/osmose.svg)](https://github.com/osmose-model/osmose/issues)
```
