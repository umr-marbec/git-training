Website creation
==================

GitHub allows the creation and hosting of websites using the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
features. It is particularly usefull for students or postdoc who want to host their personal website.

# Repository creation

First, create a repository called `username.github.io`, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub. 
**This is the reason why your GitHub username
should be as close as possible to your real name.**

**Warning: The repository must obviously be public**

# Clone your repository

Clone your repository as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```

# Initialisation

Add an `index.html` file into your repository, and push it to the remote directory. The `index.html` file is necessary, but you can add as
many files as you want. 

# Website address

Your website will be accessible at the **https://username.github.io**. For example, the https://w3c.github.io/ page is 
associated with the https://github.com/w3c/w3c.github.io repository
