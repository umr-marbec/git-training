Connecting GitHub with Zenodo
==================================

In the context of reproducible science, it is a good practice to make your code citable. This can be achieved for instance by connecting your GitHub repository 
to a Zenodo account, as described [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

**To insure that it works, you must create a LICENSE file directly from GitHub.** If you use non-standard license files, Zenodo will fail to generate a 
DOI.

To create a proper license file, follow the following procedure (summarized [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-open-source-licenses-work-and-how-to-add-them-to-your-projects-34310c3cf94/))

- Open your GitHub repository in a browser.
- In the root directory, click on `Create new file`.
- Name the file `LICENSE`.
- Click on `Choose a license template`.
- Pick one of the licenses.
- Once chosen, click on `Review and submit`.
- Commit the file.
