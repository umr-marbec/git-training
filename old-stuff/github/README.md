## How authenticating yourself with GitHub

There are two options of protocols for secure communication working over
a computer network!

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

If you plan to work using HTTPS protocol, you can follow [Cache
credential for
HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html#credential-caching)
for more information.

### SSH

If you plan to work using SSH protocol, you can follow [Set up keys
for SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys) for more
information.

# Create a repository

To create a repository, click on the `Repositories` link of your profile and click on `New`. You should see the following:

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/github-repo1.png" width=100%>
</div>

Fill on the informations. If you create an empty repository, you should see the following:

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/github-repo2.png" width=100%>
</div>

In this case, there is nothing in the repository, i.e. there is no branch. 

**It is strongly advised to initialise the repository using a `README.md`, a `.gitignore` and a `LICENSE` file.**. In this case, a `master` branch containing
any of these files will be created as the starting point of your work.

# Delete a repository

To delete a repository, click on the `Settings` link of the repository and scroll down at the very bottom. You will find the following:
