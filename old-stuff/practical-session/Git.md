# Git

The aim of the current session is to learn how to work on GitHub.

# Create an authentification token

# Creation of a repository

Create a `git-class` repository on your personal account following the given [steps](https://github.com/umr-marbec/git-training/tree/master/github)

When this is done, clone the repository either using HTTPS or SSH: 

```
git clone git@github.com:barriern/git-class.git 
# git clone https://github.com/barriern/git-class.git
```

# First commit

Go in the directory and type:

```
git status
git remote -vv
git branch -vv
```

Add a `README.md` file by typing:

```
touch README.md
git status
```

Add the file to the index:

```
git add README.md 
git status
```

Commit the file by typing:

```
git commit -m "create readme.md"
``` 

If you didn't use the `-m` argument, add a commit message, for instance `Create README.md`. Then check status

```
git status
``` 

Send the changes to the remote repository

```
git push
git status
git branch -vv
```

# Fetch and Pull

Visit the page of your repository and refresh. You should see the `README.md` file. From the web page, click on the `Add file -> Create new file` and type `LICENSE`. Then choose a license template, click on `Review and submit` and commit to the main branch (`master` or `main`)

Go back to terminal and type:

```
echo "# README title" >> README.md
git status
```

Add and commit your file, as done previously using `git add` and `git commit`. To save time, you can type:

```
git commit -m "update readme.md" README.md  # does a add and a commit in one shot
```

Try to push your changes to the remote using `git push`. The push will fail, since the remote repository contains work that has not been updated into your local repository.

To update your local repository, type:

```
git fetch
git status
```

You will see that the LICENSE file is not yet in your local workspace. This is normal, since it `fetch` puts it into the **local repository**. To update the workspace by merging your local commit and the remote one, type:

```
git pull
```

A commit will be automatically created. It's goal is to merge the local commits (the update of the `README.md` file) with the one done in GitHub (the creation of the `LICENSE` file). Now type:

```
git status
```

You will see that the new commit was only made locally, and need to be update to the remote one:

```
git push
```

Check what happened in the `Insight -> Network` page of your repository or by typing:

```bash
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

**Note: `git pull` is a combination of two operations: `git fetch` and `git merge`. In the above, the `git fetch` is therefore unnecessary**

# Conflicts

At the end of the `README.md` file, add the line `x = local`. Commit the change using `git add` and `git commit`. **Don't `push`!**

Now from GitHub, add at the end of the `README.md` file, add the line `x = github` and commit to `master`.

From the terminal, now try to `push`. An error occurs, inviting you to do a `git pull`. Do it.

You should now see an error message relative to conflicts. Type `git status` to see what is going on.

Now, open the README.md file from the Terminal. You should see something like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
x = local
=======
x = github
>>>>>>> 2c87e6bfe6d70298ecfce00ec2a6f1822b354495
```

This invites you to conflict resolution. The lines between `HEAD` and `=======` is the content of your local repository, while the lines between 
`=======` and `>>>>>>>` is the state of the commit you are trying to merge.

To resolve conflict, choose one of the `x` values and remove all the conflict symbols. Save the file.

Validate the manual merging by typing `git add README.md` and `git commit`. Push to the remote repository.

**Warning: resolving conflicts is error prone! This can be avoided by regular push/pull**

# Branches

Create a branch that derivates from master as follows:

```
git checkout -b develop
```

Check using `git branch -vv`

Do some commits in that branch.

Try to push. It fails since the branch does not exist remotely. Create the remote branch by using

```
git push --set-upstream origin develop
```

and check using `git branch -vv`

Merge the `develop` branch into `master` as follows:

```
git checkout master
git merge develop
```

Check using `git branch -vv`

Push to `master`

Remove the `develop` branch *locally*:

```
git branch -d develop
git branch -vv
```

Now delete the branch *remotely*

```
git push origin --delete develop
```
