## What is Git?

Git is a **version manager software** (also called version control) 

Why is version control so important?

- Tracks changes (*commits*) over time
    - Who? When? What change?    
- Saves snapshots of a project (*tags*)
    - Highlight critical stages of a project (new versions)
- Creates derivates of a project (*branches*)
- Facilitates collaboration among multiple users
