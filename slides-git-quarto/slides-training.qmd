## What is version control?

Version Control Softwares (VCS, also known as Version Manager) allow to:

<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->

- Track changes (*commits*) of a project from the very beginning
    - Who? When? What changes?    
- Save snapshots of a project (*tags*)
    - Highlight critical stages (new versions for instance)
- Create derivates of a project (*branches*)
- Eventually go back in time

<!-- ::: -->

## In other words...

::: {layout-ncol=2 layout-valign="bottom"}

## Other advantages of VCS

In addition, VCS allow to:

- Save a project remotely (GitHub, Gitlab, etc.)
    - Synchronization with different computers (laptop, HPCs)
- Share a project (codes, packages) with the community
    - Reproducible science
- Facilitate working organization
    - One project (paper, package) = one repository
    - Folder organization (sources, doc, data, etc.)

## Why use Git?

Several version control software exist (cf. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software)). So why use ![](../presentation_gitTraining/img/git_logo.png){height=35 fig-align="center" layout-valign="center" .inline-image} ?



- Popular and successful
- Works offline (contrary to SVN)
- Branching capabilities
    - Cheap and easy to merge
    - Even more so with the [Git-Flow](https://git-flow.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/index.html) extension
- Tracks any type of files
    - Works best with ASCII files (`.R`, `.py`, `.tex`)
    - Large binary files with [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (`.Rdata`, `.csv`, `.nc`) extension
